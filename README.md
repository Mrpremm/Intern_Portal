Step 1: Get the Files
Download or clone all 3 code files:
index.html, style.css, and app.js

Keep them in a single folder.

Step 2: Open the Dashboard
Just double-click index.html.

It will open in your web browser (like Chrome or Edge).

That’s it—the whole portal runs right there!
No need to install anything, no backend needed, no server hassle.

Step 3: Try It Out
You’ll see a login/signup page.

For login, use an email like: john.doe@example.com
(password can be anything, 6+ letters)

You can also sign up with your own name/email for demo.

Step 4: Explore
Check out your Dashboard: Your name, referral code, donations, rewards—all with dummy (fake) backend data.

Click on Leaderboard to see other fake interns.

It works perfectly on mobile and desktop.
